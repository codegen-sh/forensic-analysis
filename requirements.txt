# Jeffrey Epstein Prison Video Forensic Analysis
# Python Dependencies

# Template engine for HTML report generation
jinja2>=3.0.0

# No other external Python packages required - uses only standard library
# However, you need these system tools installed:

# System Dependencies (install via package manager):
# - ffmpeg (video processing)
# - ffprobe (usually comes with ffmpeg)
# - exiftool (metadata extraction)

# Installation instructions by platform:

# Ubuntu/Debian:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install ffmpeg exiftool python3

# macOS (with Homebrew):
# brew install ffmpeg exiftool python3

# Windows:
# 1. Install Python from https://python.org
# 2. Download ffmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add to PATH
# 3. Download exiftool from https://exiftool.org and add to PATH

# All required functionality is provided by Python's standard library:
# - os (file operations)
# - sys (system operations)
# - json (JSON processing)
# - subprocess (running external commands)
# - urllib.request (downloading files)
# - re (regular expressions)
# - base64 (encoding)
# - datetime (timestamp handling)
# - xml.etree.ElementTree (XML parsing)

# The analysis relies on external command-line tools rather than Python packages
# to ensure compatibility with industry-standard digital forensics workflows.
