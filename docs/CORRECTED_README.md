# Jeffrey Epstein Prison Video Technical Analysis

A computational analysis of DOJ surveillance video metadata and compression patterns that reveals technical indicators consistent with video processing through Adobe software.

## üîç Key Technical Observations

- Contains metadata signatures from **Adobe Media Encoder 2024.0**
- References **multiple source video files** in timeline data
- Shows **compression pattern variations** at specific timestamps
- Exhibits **frame discontinuities** at approximately 6 hours 36 minutes
- May have undergone post-recording processing

## üî¨ Technical Findings Summary

### Adobe Software Signatures
- **Software Metadata**: Adobe Media Encoder 2024.0 (Windows)
- **User Account Reference**: `MJCOLE~1`
- **Project File Reference**: `mcc_4.prproj`
- **XMP Metadata**: Adobe-specific processing data present

*Note: Metadata presence indicates Adobe software processing occurred, though the context and timing of this processing requires clarification.*

### Source File References
- **File 1**: `2025-05-22 21-12-48.mp4` (23.76 seconds)
- **File 2**: `2025-05-22 16-35-21.mp4` (15.56 seconds)
- **Timeline Duration**: ~39 seconds of referenced content

*Note: Multiple source file references may indicate editing, but could also result from legitimate processing, archival procedures, or format conversion.*

### Compression Pattern Analysis
- **Observation Location**: 23,760.47 seconds (6h 36m 0s) into the video
- **Pattern Change**: Compression ratio variations observed
- **Frame Analysis**: File size discontinuities detected between consecutive frames

*Note: Compression variations can result from multiple factors including scene complexity, encoding parameters, or potential editing. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.*

### üîç Compression Ratio Observations
- **Baseline Range**: Compression ratios typically 12-15% throughout most video
- **Anomalous Pattern**: Elevated compression ratios (~85%) observed at specific timestamp
- **Duration**: Pattern persists for approximately 3 seconds
- **[üìñ Detailed Analysis](docs/compression_ratio_explanation.md)** | **[üìä Interactive Visualization](docs/compression_analysis_diagram.html)**

*Note: These patterns warrant further investigation but may have alternative explanations including natural encoding variations or technical processing artifacts.*

3. Download exiftool from https://exiftool.org and add to PATH

### Installation & Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codegen-sh/forensic-analysis.git
cd forensic-analysis

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
python epstein_video_analyzer.py
```

### What the Analysis Does

1. **Downloads** the 19.5 GB DOJ video automatically
2. **Extracts** comprehensive metadata using industry-standard tools
3. **Identifies** Adobe software signatures and timeline references
4. **Analyzes** frame characteristics around observed discontinuities
5. **Generates** technical analysis reports
6. **Creates** visual documentation of observed patterns

## üìÅ Output Files

After running the analysis, you'll find:

- **`analysis_report.html`** - Main technical report (open in browser)
- **`raw_video.mp4`** - Downloaded DOJ video file (19.5 GB)
- **`metadata.json`** - Complete extracted metadata
- **`xmp_metadata.xml`** - Adobe XMP processing metadata
- **`splice_frames/`** - Extracted frames around discontinuities
- **`splice_evidence_visualization.html`** - Interactive frame comparison

## üîç Key Analysis Commands

### Extract Adobe Processing Metadata
```bash
exiftool -CreatorTool -WindowsAtomUncProjectPath raw_video.mp4
# Output: Adobe Media Encoder 2024.0 (Windows)
```

### Calculate Timeline Reference Location
```bash
python3 -c "print(6035539564454400 / 254016000000)"
# Output: 23760.47 seconds = 6h 36m 0s
```

### Extract Frames Around Discontinuity
```bash
ffmpeg -ss 23759 -t 4 -vf "fps=1" -q:v 2 splice_frames/frame_%03d.png raw_video.mp4
```

### Analyze Frame Size Patterns
```bash
ls -la splice_frames/frame_*.png | awk '{print $9, $5}'
# Shows file size variations between frames
```

## üìä Technical Observations Summary

### Metadata Indicators
