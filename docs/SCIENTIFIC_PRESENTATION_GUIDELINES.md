# Scientific Presentation Guidelines for Forensic Analysis

## Purpose

These guidelines establish standards for maintaining scientific rigor and credibility in forensic analysis documentation. They are designed to prevent overstatement of findings, ensure appropriate uncertainty quantification, and maintain professional standards in technical communication.

## Core Principles

### 1. Distinguish Observations from Interpretations
**Always clearly separate:**
- **Technical observations** (what the analysis shows)
- **Interpretations** (what the observations might mean)
- **Conclusions** (what can be reasonably inferred)
- **Speculations** (what might be possible but unverified)

### 2. Quantify Uncertainty
**Every finding should include:**
- Confidence levels where applicable
- Error margins and limitations
- Alternative explanations
- Validation requirements

### 3. Use Appropriate Language
**Replace definitive language with qualified statements:**
- "Analysis suggests" instead of "proves"
- "Consistent with" instead of "demonstrates"
- "Indicates" instead of "confirms"
- "Preliminary findings" instead of "definitive results"

## Language Guidelines

### Prohibited Language (Never Use)

#### Absolute Certainty Claims
❌ **NEVER USE:**
- "Definitive proof"
- "Irrefutable evidence"
- "Computational proof"
- "Mathematical certainty"
- "Beyond doubt"
- "Impossible naturally"
- "Technical impossibility"

#### Causal Claims Without Evidence
❌ **NEVER USE:**
- "Proves intentional manipulation"
- "Demonstrates deliberate editing"
- "Shows deceptive practices"
- "Confirms malicious intent"

#### Unsupported Statistical Claims
❌ **NEVER USE:**
- Statistical significance without proper methodology
- Confidence percentages without calculation basis
- "Virtually impossible" without statistical foundation
- P-values without hypothesis testing framework

### Recommended Language (Always Use)

#### For Technical Observations
✅ **USE:**
- "Analysis indicates"
- "Technical examination reveals"
- "Metadata examination shows"
- "Patterns consistent with"
- "Observations suggest"

#### For Interpretations
✅ **USE:**
- "Findings are consistent with"
- "Results suggest the possibility of"
- "Technical indicators may indicate"
- "Preliminary analysis suggests"
- "Further investigation is needed to determine"

#### For Limitations
✅ **USE:**
- "Analysis is limited by"
- "Alternative explanations include"
- "Findings require validation through"
- "Uncertainty exists regarding"
- "Independent verification is recommended"

## Statistical Reporting Standards

### Requirements for Statistical Claims

#### 1. Methodology Documentation
**Before making any statistical claim, document:**
- Sample size and selection criteria
- Baseline calculation methodology
- Statistical test used and justification
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Significance level chosen and rationale

#### 2. Proper Statistical Language
**Use correct terminology:**
- "Standard deviation" (not "sigma" without context)
- "Confidence interval" (not "confidence level" for percentages)
- "P-value" (with proper interpretation)
- "Effect size" (with appropriate measures)

#### 3. Uncertainty Quantification
**Always include:**
- Confidence intervals for estimates
- Error margins for measurements
- Limitations of statistical analysis
- Assumptions underlying statistical tests

### Example of Proper Statistical Reporting

**Instead of:** "4.2σ statistical significance (99.999% certainty)"

**Use:** "Compression ratio analysis comparing baseline frames (n=1000, M=14.2%, SD=2.1%) to anomalous frames (n=50, M=85.3%, SD=15.7%) using Welch's t-test showed a significant difference (t(49)=42.3, p<0.001, 95% CI [78.2%, 92.4%], Cohen's d=4.2). However, this analysis has limitations including [list specific limitations] and requires independent validation."

## Technical Claims Standards

### Metadata Analysis
**Appropriate claims:**
- "Metadata indicates Adobe software processing"
- "Timeline data references multiple source files"
- "XMP data contains editing signatures"

**Inappropriate claims:**
- "Proves video was edited"
- "Demonstrates deceptive manipulation"
- "Confirms tampering occurred"

### Compression Analysis
**Appropriate claims:**
- "Compression patterns vary at specific timestamps"
- "Frame characteristics show discontinuities"
- "Compression ratios differ from baseline measurements"

**Inappropriate claims:**
- "Impossible compression changes"
- "Definitive evidence of splicing"
- "Technical impossibility of natural occurrence"

### Frame Analysis
**Appropriate claims:**
- "Frame analysis reveals size discontinuities"
- "Visual patterns correlate with metadata timestamps"
- "Frame characteristics change at observed locations"

**Inappropriate claims:**
- "Proves splice points exist"
- "Confirms video manipulation"
- "Demonstrates content substitution"

## Disclaimer Requirements

### Mandatory Disclaimers
**Every document must include:**

#### Analysis Limitations
- Scope and constraints of analysis
- Tool limitations and capabilities
- Methodology constraints
- Validation requirements

#### Uncertainty Acknowledgment
- Confidence levels for findings
- Alternative explanations
- Sources of potential error
- Need for independent verification

#### Appropriate Use
- Intended applications
- Inappropriate uses
- Context requirements
- Expert interpretation needs

### Disclaimer Template
```markdown
## Important Disclaimers

### Analysis Limitations
This analysis is limited by [specific limitations]. Findings represent preliminary technical observations that require independent validation and expert interpretation within appropriate investigative context.

### Uncertainty Factors
Results include uncertainty due to [specific factors]. Alternative explanations for observed patterns include [list alternatives]. Independent verification is recommended for all findings.

### Appropriate Use
This analysis is suitable for [appropriate uses] but should not be used for [inappropriate uses] without additional validation and expert interpretation.
```

## Visual Presentation Standards

### Charts and Graphs
**Requirements:**
- Include error bars or uncertainty indicators
- Label axes clearly with units and scales
- Provide context for anomalies or outliers
- Include baseline comparisons where appropriate
- Add disclaimers about interpretation

**Prohibited:**
- Charts that visually overemphasize anomalies
- Graphs without proper scale context
- Visualizations that imply certainty without supporting data
- Charts without uncertainty indicators

### Interactive Visualizations
**Requirements:**
- Include uncertainty information in tooltips
- Provide context for all data points
- Allow users to see underlying data
- Include methodology explanations
- Add appropriate disclaimers

## Peer Review Requirements

### Before Publication
**All technical documents must undergo:**
